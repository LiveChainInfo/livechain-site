# Memory Resolution Engine (Future Concept)

The Memory Resolution Engine is a proposed subcomponent of the LiveChain protocol that:
- Dynamically prioritizes what metadata to retain or discard
- Applies context-aware filters to determine what becomes permanent provenance
- Interfaces with both AI decisioning logic and quantum validation checkpoints

This system ensures that only *meaningful memory* is preserved â€” balancing compute/storage constraints with auditability and ethical traceability.

## Features (Planned)
- Signal prioritization logic
- Contextual awareness via AI metadata
- Configurable governance over memory resolution thresholds
