# LiveChain Core Architecture

The LiveChain Core is a proposed hybrid processor design that integrates classical compute logic with quantum verification systems to provide real-time provenance anchoring.

## Components
- **Classical Execution Cores**: Handle app logic, AI inference, and external interfaces.
- **Quantum Monitor Subsystem**: Verifies intent, lineage, and behavioral consistency through quantum measurements.
- **Trust Arbiter Logic**: Determines whether to accept, reject, or sandbox events based on verification.
- **Provenance Buffer**: Temporarily holds metadata prior to anchoring.
- **Blockchain Archive**: Final destination for verified lineage records.
